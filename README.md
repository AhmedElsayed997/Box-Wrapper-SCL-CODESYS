# Box-Wrapper-SCL-CODESYS

This project implements a state machine logic to control a mechanical wrapping or box-handling system, likely part of a packaging process. The logic uses sensors, counters, and motor outputs to move through defined operational stages.

## Main States:
DOWN_STAGE – Moves the mechanism downward while monitoring rotation.

UP_STAGE – Moves the mechanism upward until it hits a limit sensor.
